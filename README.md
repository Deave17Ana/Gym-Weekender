This project leverages Agile and Lean project management practices to deliver a fitness initiative for seniors aged 60 and above. A collaboration between Pure Gym and Age UK, the Gym Weekender aims to enhance both physical and mental wellbeing through accessible, community-focused fitness classes such as Zumba, Yoga, and HIT. Using the Agile framework, the project emphasizes flexibility, stakeholder collaboration, and iterative development, with regular feedback loops to meet seniors' needs effectively. Lean principles ensure efficient resource allocation and cost management, aligning with the charityâ€™s goals. Located in Bromley, a central hub for elderly populations, the initiative fosters a safe, inclusive space for seniors to connect and thrive, while maintaining robust communication and coordination among stakeholders.
